            <p>
                Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG set in the magical continent of Teyvat, where seven nations <br>
                 are governed by elemental Archons. Players take on the role of the Traveler, exploring vast landscapes,<br>
                  solving puzzles, and uncovering the secrets of this beautifully crafted world.<br>
                The game features dynamic combat that utilizes elemental reactions, allowing players to combine the powers <br>
                of Anemo, Geo, Electro, Dendro, Hydro, Pyro, and Cryo for powerful effects. With a diverse roster of characters,<br>
                 each with unique abilities and stories, team-building and strategy play a key role in battles. <br>
            </p>

                The game features a stylish cyberpunk aesthetic with fluid combat mechanics, allowing seamless character switching and <br>
                combo attacks. Each character has unique abilities and fighting styles, encouraging strategic team compositions. <br>
